# The Derman & Wilmott Modeler's Manifesto Model Card

## What system actually determines the predicted variable, and how does it differ from a computational model?
**The Modeler's Hippocratic Oath (I)**
> I will remember that I didn't make the world, and it doesn't satisfy my equations.


##  We expect this model achieves novel results mainly as a consequence of these novel techniques (and not any kind of magic or infallibility):
**The Modeler's Hippocratic Oath (II)**
> Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I will not be overly impressed by mathematics.


## We have excluded the following outliers, edge cases, and inconvenient truths:
**The Modeler's Hippocratic Oath (III)**
> I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without explaining why I have done so.


## This model cannot be relied upon in the following scenarios:
**The Modeler's Hippocratic Oath (IV)**
> Nor will I give the people who use my model false comfort about its accuracy. ...

## We have made the following mathematical, statistical, and computational assumptions:
**The Modeler's Hippocratic Oath (IV)**
> ... Instead, I will make explicit its assumptions and oversights.


## We have done the following to mitigate real-world harms from this model:
**The Modeler's Hippocratic Oath (V)**
> I understand that my work may have enormous effects on society and the economy, ...


## We acknowledge these potential harms are unmitigated, and there may be many unforseen consequences from the model's use or misuse:
**The Modeler's Hippocratic Oath (V)**
> ... many of them beyond my comprehension.
