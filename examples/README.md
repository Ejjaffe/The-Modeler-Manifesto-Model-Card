### [Smiling Detection](examples/Smiling Detection.md)
This Model card is intended to be compared with the first example from [Model Cards for Model Reporting (Mitchell et al)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03993.pdf). It is for a Smiling Detection CNN Model trained on the CelebA dataset. (Disclaimer: This is an example and not necessarily factual. My apologies if I get some of the following information incorrect. I am by no means an expert on smiling or very familliar with the original paper.)
